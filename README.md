# Bookmarking-Site-PagePal

This is the back-end of a webpage to streamline the user login process, save and store book, movie, and link data, create user, editor, and manager restrictions, define genres, and create a kid friendly status. At the moment, the project is only in Java and the information is stored in the DataStore class, with txt files serving as the information feed. More updates to come, with some front end design and implementation of mySQL.
